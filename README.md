Long Distance Friendship Lamps developed in C++:
Two lights that are connected together around the world no matter where they are, as long as they are connected to the internet!

How to use magic lights:
1. Gently press light button to activate a random colour, this will cause the other light to also light up with the same colour
2. To turn off light, hold the light button gently for 3 seconds
3. The light will automatically turn off after 2 hours
4. Use the potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the light!

Rave update:

2. Use the potentiometer to adjust the speed of the flashing to match your desired song bpm
3. To turn off, clack the light button hard again and the light will turn off
